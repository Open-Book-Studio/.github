# Open-Book-Studio 开卷有益工作室 👋

## 🙋‍♀️ What is Open-Book-Studio all about?
## 🙋‍♀️ 开卷有益工作室是做什么的？

Inspired by the ancient Chinese proverb "开卷有益" (Opening a book is beneficial), Open-Book-Studio is an open-source initiative dedicated to fostering collaborative learning and knowledge sharing. We believe that learning should be accessible, transparent, and mutually beneficial.  

古人云，“开卷有益”（打开书卷，受益匪浅）。受此启发，我们创建了开卷(juan4)有益工作室，这是一个致力于推动协作学习和知识共享的开源项目。我们相信，学习应该是开放的、透明的，并且互惠互利。

> 希望大家能够一起开卷(juan4)，互相学习进步，而不是在这个内卷(juan3)的环境下闭门造车，各自为战。
> 为此，我们不提倡大家开卷(juan3)，我们认为学习不能只是为了得到高分，而是为了自己学到知识。

Our mission is to:
- 📚 Openly share coursework, assignments, and insights from various academic fields.
- 🗣️Encourage discussions and problem-solving around coursework challenges, fostering a community of learners who help each other grow.
